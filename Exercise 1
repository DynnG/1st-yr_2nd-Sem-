/* Name: Geraldyn Cataluna                                       BSCS 1A

This program defines three classes, HelloObject, WassupObject, and YoObject, each designed to print a specific greeting multiple times. Each class has a constructor that initializes a greeting message and a method to print the greeting a specified number of times. In the HelloTester class, instances of these three classes are created with their respective greetings, and their methods are called to display the greetings.
